## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

getwd()
setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/ProjetFinal_visu/flask-scripts/static")
log <- read.table("magnetotf.csv",header=T,sep=",")
matrice<- read.table("magnetolog.csv",header=T,sep=",")
names(log)<-c("Mots","Log")
matrice<-round(matrice[,c(2280:2380)],2)
tab <- matrice[matrice[,57]!=0.00,]
log<-log[c(55),]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
